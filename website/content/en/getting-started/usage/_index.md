  This guide will walk you through the steps to configure and run the Azure Key Vault provider for Secrets Store CSI driver on Kubernetes.
---

#### Create a new Azure Key Vault resource or use an existing one

In addition to a Kubernetes cluster, you will need an Azure Key Vault resource with secret content to access. Follow [this quickstart tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal) to deploy an Azure Key Vault and add an example secret to it.

Review the settings you desire for your Key Vault, such as what resources (Azure VMs, Azure Resource Manager, etc.) and what kind of network endpoints can access secrets in it.

Take note of the following properties for use in the next section:

1. Name of secret object in Key Vault
1. Secret content type (secret, key, cert)
1. Name of Key Vault resource
1. Azure Tenant ID the Subscription belongs to

#### Create your own SecretProviderClass Object

Create a `SecretProviderClass` custom resource to provide provider-specific parameters for the Secrets Store CSI driver. In this example, use an existing Azure Key Vault or the Azure Key Vault resource created previously.

> NOTE: The `SecretProviderClass` has to be in the same namespace as the pod referencing it.

Update [this sample deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/master/examples/service-principal/v1alpha1_secretproviderclass_service_principal.yaml) to create a `SecretProviderClass` resource to provide Azure-specific parameters for the Secrets Store CSI driver.

To provide identity to access Key Vault, refer to the following [section](#provide-identity-to-access-key-vault).

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
  kind: SecretProviderClass
  metadata:
    name: azure-kvname
  spec:
    provider: azure
    parameters:

      useVMManagedIdentity: "false"         # [OPTIONAL available for version > 0.0.4] if not provided, will default to "false"
      userAssignedIdentityID: "client_id"   # [OPTIONAL available for version > 0.0.4] use the client id to specify which user assigned managed identity to use. If using a user assigned identity as the VM's managed identity, then specify the identity's client id. If empty, then defaults to use the system assigned identity on the VM
      clientID: "client_id"                 # [OPTIONAL available for version > 1.1.0] client id of the Azure AD Application or managed identity to use for workload identity
      keyvaultName: "kvname"                # the name of the KeyVault
      cloudName: ""                         # [OPTIONAL available for version > 0.0.4] if not provided, azure environment will default to AzurePublicCloud

            objectVersion: ""
      tenantId: "tid"                       # the tenant ID of the KeyVault

#### Provide Identity to Access Key Vault

The Azure Key Vault Provider offers five modes for accessing a Key Vault instance:

1. [Service Principal](../../configurations/identity-access-modes/service-principal-mode) ** This is currently the only way to connect to Azure Key Vault from a non Azure environment.
2. [Pod Identity](../../configurations/identity-access-modes/pod-identity-mode)
3. [User-assigned Managed Identity](../../configurations/identity-access-modes/user-assigned-msi-mode)
4. [System-assigned Managed Identity](../../configurations/identity-access-modes/system-assigned-msi-mode)
5. [Workload Identity](../../configurations/identity-access-modes/workload-identity-mode)

#### Update your Deployment Yaml

To ensure your application is using the Secrets Store CSI driver, update your deployment yaml to use the `secrets-store.csi.k8s.io` driver and reference the `SecretProviderClass` resource created in the previous step.

Update your [deployment yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/master/examples/service-principal/pod-inline-volume-service-principal.yaml) to use the Secrets Store CSI driver and reference the `SecretProviderClass` resource created in the previous step.

  ```yaml
    volumes:
      - name: secrets-store-inline
        csi:
          driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
          readOnly: true
          volumeAttributes:
            secretProviderClass: "azure-kvname"
  ```

#### Deploy your Kubernetes Resources

  1. Deploy the SecretProviderClass yaml created previously. For example:

     `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/master/examples/service-principal/v1alpha1_secretproviderclass_service_principal.yaml`

  1. Deploy the application yaml created previously. For example:

     `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/master/examples/service-principal/pod-inline-volume-service-principal.yaml`

#### Validate the secret

To validate, once the pod is started, you should see the new mounted content at the volume path specified in your deployment yaml.

  ```bash
  ## show secrets held in secrets-store
  kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-inline -- ls /mnt/secrets-store/

  ## print a test secret held in secrets-store
  kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-inline -- cat /mnt/secrets-store/secret1
  ```

#### Syncing Multiple Versions of a Secret

The Azure Key Vault Provider allows syncing previous versions of a secret via the `objectVersionHistory` property. If this property is specified, and the value is greater than 1, the provider will sync up to that many versions of the specified secret starting with the version specified. The file name for each version of the secret will be `{objectAlias}/{versionIndex}` where version index is the 0-based starting with the latest version.

If you want to sync one of these versions with a kubernetes secret, the only difference is that you have to specify which version you want (i.e., to use the latest version, you specify `{objectAlias}/0` in `[secretObjects].[objectName]`)

##### Permissions

If you use this functionality, the principal being used to access Key Vault will also need the list permission for secrets, keys, and certificates.
