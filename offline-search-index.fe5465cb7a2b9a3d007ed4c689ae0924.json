This is backward incompatible with the prior releases.\n The Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver has been designed to closely align with the current behavior of az keyvault certificate/secret/key download.\nAzure Key Vault design makes sharp distinctions between Keys, Secrets and Certificates. The KeyVault service’s Certificates features were designed making use of it’s Keys and Secrets capabilities.\n When a Key Vault certificate is created, an addressable key and secret are also created with the same name. The Key Vault key allows key operations and the Key Vault secret allows retrieval of the certificate value as a secret.
